# Traffic Optimization using Reinforcement Learning

**Inzva AI Projects-2** 

## Aim
We want to use Reinforcement Learning algorithms to optimize traffic 
with driverless cars. Biggest difference between our project and previous
 work done in the field is that in our simulation environment, cars 
 doesn't need to stick to modern traffic rules such as traffic lights and 
 road lines as long as they don't crush. We will search for a faster and safer
  traffic where such constraints are removed. 

## Setup and Run
Download or clone the project folder. Within the folder,
run `deneme.py` to start the simulation. 

Note: `deneme` is the current state of the created gym environment. 
Agents are not controlled with an RL algorithm yet. But the enviorenment has all the 
necessary functions (step(), reset() etc.) and ready to run by an RL algorithm.
